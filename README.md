# bootstrap-portfolio

## Purpose

The purpose of this portfolio site is to begin to learn and implement the Bootstrap framework.  The pages were designed in a similar layout and color scheme as my original portfolio page with a focus on making the site responsive in addition to implementing Bootstrap elements, row and column layouts, and Bootstrap utility classes for styling as opposed to traditional CSS.  Included is breif descriptions and screen grabs of various pages and elements of my portfolio site including challenges faced along the way.

## Navbar

The navbar consists of a row with two columns, including a header in the left and a navbar on the right.  When viewed at full desktop width, the navigation should be on the right and the header to the left.  At the small breakpoint, the header and nav stack on top of eachother and become center justified for mobile veiwing.

 **Challenges** The biggest challenge faced with the navbar came from trying to make it responsive, without just copying a default navbar from bootstrap.  I wanted to use bootstrap elements while still styling the nav to look similar to the previous version and remaining responsive.

## About 

The main content of the About Me was a straight-forward container with one row containg a header and the second row containg two columns.  The columns consist of a pic and a brief bio paragraph that are displayed in line when viewed at full width but then stack at the small breakpoint.

## Portfolio

The portfolio page uses rows and columns containing Bootstrap cards to display a few projects from my portfolio.  The images are responsive and scale as the veiwport size grows.  The images are displayed two per row but stack one per row at the small breakpoint.

 **Challenges**  The biggest obstacle to overcome in this section, and this entire project as a whole, was understanding the breakpoints and changing the column sizes accordingly to have images display properly on every screen width.
